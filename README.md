Bracket
=======

This source repository holds the beginning of a CAS (computer algebra 
system) written in the programming language Racket. 

The goal is not to write a CAS with the scope of Maxima and Mathematica,
but rather to make CAS that can handle high school problems including
symbolic equation solving, differentiation, integration and sums.

The GUI will be inspired by NSpire which interface is very accessible
to high school students (but whose programming language, well, is
rather poor). Since Racket supports platforms independent GUIs til
program will be available on Windows, OS X, and, Linux.

That said, Bracket is not in a usable shape yet. Development has
just begon.

Spin off mathematics libraries will be made available on PLaneT.
